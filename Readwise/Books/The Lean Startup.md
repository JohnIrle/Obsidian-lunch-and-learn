## Highlights
- The grim reality is that most startups fail. Most new products are not successful. Most new ventures do not live up to their potential. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=114))
- That’s because total manufacturing output in the United States is increasing (by 15 percent in the last decade) even as jobs continue to be lost (see the charts below). In effect, the huge productivity increases made possible by modern management and technology have created more productive capacity than firms know what to do with.

- The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible. In other words, the Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time.

- A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=380))
- Anything those customers experience from their interaction with a company should be considered part of that company’s product. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=390))
- The Innovator’s Dilemma: they are very good at creating incremental improvements to existing products and serving existing customers, which Christensen called sustaining innovation, but struggle to create breakthrough new products—disruptive innovation—that can create new sustainable sources of growth. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=426))
- Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=519))
- Imagine a world in which you own the only telephone; it would have no value. Only when other people also have a telephone does it become valuable. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=536))
- Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=652))
- In a manufacturing business, customers don’t care how the product is assembled, only that it works correctly. But in a startup, who the customer is and what the customer might find valuable are unknown, part of the very uncertainty that is an essential part of the definition of a startup. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=653))
- We adopted the view that our job was to find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they ought to want. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=685))
- The value hypothesis tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=829))
- For the growth hypothesis, which tests how new customers will discover a product or service, we can do a similar analysis. Once the program is up and running, how will it spread among the employees, from initial early adopters to mass adoption throughout the company? ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=835))
- The common tendency of product development is to skip straight to the fourth question and build a solution before confirming that customers have the problem. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=876))
