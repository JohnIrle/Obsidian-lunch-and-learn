- Properties are a standardization of YAML frontmatter. 
- You can add the property block to the top of the file by typing `---` or selecting `Add File Property` from the command pallet.
- Properties look across all of your notes and add auto completion based on other notes that have provided a value for that property.
- There are property types that can be selected by clicking the icon next to the property.
- The `All Properties` view shows all properties set on your notes, which can help you catch typos.
- Links set in properties are respected and show on the graph.
